//TODO
code gen for uniforms
code gen for buffers

todo asserts for modification methods
todo asserts for in/out args in main
assert last statement is returns (count ifs with elses)
function overloading
logging
structures
classes
geometry shader
tessellation shader
compute shader
uniforms are common for both vertex and fragment, handle it some how
  check same type
  prevent somehow from filling from FS
  fs extends vs ?
  separate structure for uniforms ?

close SimpleWatch3D if shader didn't loaded
  or just don't spawn logs

Groovy don't detects wrong assignment
    o.gl_FragColor = foo2(sum);
    void foo2(Vec4f vv) {vv.w = 1}


//DONE
asserts
  varyings, uniforms, vectors
functions
prefix for VS output (FS input) to avoid name clashing
